#Travel Buddy

Travel Buddy is a trip planning site. It allows users to add and keep track of their own trips, while also allowing them to view and/or join other users' trips. Before they decide if they want to join a trip, they can view information about each individual trip by selecting that particular trip.

##How to use

###Login page
Users register and login to an account where they can add trips to the database and view them on them on the main page.

They can also view trips added by all other users and join those trips, which will add them to their own trips. Users can also click on individual trips which will direct them to another page that displays information for that particular trip.
