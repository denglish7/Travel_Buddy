#Travel Buddy

Travel Buddy is a trip planning site. It allows users to add and keep track of their own trips, while also allowing them to view and/or join other users' trips. Before they decide if they want to join a trip, they can view information about each individual trip by selecting that particular trip.

##How to use

###Home page
* View trips they have added
* View trips other users have added
* Join a trip another user has added which will move that trip to the logged in users' trips.

###Add page
* Add a trip to the database with a destination, description, travel dates, and a image(optional).

###Trip page
* View individual trips where all the trip info for that trip will be displayed.
